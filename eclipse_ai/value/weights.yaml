# Eclipse AI Evaluation Weights
# =============================================================================
# These weights define how the AI values different aspects of game state.
# Higher weights mean the AI prioritizes that feature more.
# Negative weights penalize that aspect.
#
# Tuning guide:
# - Increase combat weights for aggressive play
# - Increase economy weights for expansive/peaceful play
# - Increase territory weights for map control strategies
# - Adjust round-specific weights to change early/mid/late game priorities
